I am a student working to be in a cibersecurity specialist.
My language is spanish but I also can speak english

I am interested in the cibersecurity, programming, software and hardware. I study all of this since I was 10 (six years ago) years old when I started in Python.

I do Web Applications with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I have a low level but I am studying to be better,
Also Desktop Applications with C# and Java or Python
And I use Arduino with C++ and C

Now I am starting doing mobile applications with Flutter and Java.
I use SQL databases also with MySQL and no SQL databases with MongoDB.

In the past I had a business reparing PCs, Laptops and also SmartPhones but ue to lack of time I had to leave it :(

Now I want to have my first work :)

Thanks you for reading. ðŸ‘‹
